# Progress Report - Week 3

### General info
**Week**: 3
**Phase**: 2 - Research and Experiment
**Contacted**: Jean-Paul
**Document(s) handed in**: {XXX}

##### Biggest accomplishment
I got in contact with an expert on Fine Dust, who will help me extend my research as I did not have a lot of information on fine dust and its effects and behaviours in my initial research.

##### Biggest setback
The data is taking a long time, much longer than expected. This is quite a setback as I have it on a different branch to help with separating the different aspects, however if I want to change branches, the file I use to collect the data is absent so I can't do anything until I merge the data collection branch to the main branch.

### Daily progress

##### Monday
During the holiday the data was scraping, but it was not done yet. That is why it was still going on on Monday. Meanwhile I fixed an issue with my git that my commits weren't pushing due to me sending too big of a chunk of large files in one go. This could be solved by pushing using the terminal. I also contacted my stakeholder again as she was supposed to check my project plan and research but during the holiday she sent me a message that she would check it Wednesday of the holiday at the latest. I hadn't received anything yet so I wanted to confirm that I wasn't missing where it was. During the holiday I also contacted Aytaç again as he hadn't been online on teams since I sent him a message, so I contacted him through email this time.

After doing all of that, I started working on a basic CI/CD pipeline as I now had the time to work on it while waiting on my data to collect and allow Aytaç some time to respond. I also started working on a basic Software Architecture Document as a CI/CD pipeline would be part of that.

##### Tuesday
On Tuesday part of my day was trying to continue with the CI/CD pipeline however I was facing some obstacles with setting up the runner. I have used the pipeline before, but this was at a place where runners were already set up.
I also worked on my knowledge sharing session, as I learned what mistake I made for the VOG declaration so I decide since a lot of my time since the last session was spent waiting for feedback and for the data to collect, I didn't really learn a lot except for how things work at Fontys.


##### Wednesday
On Wednesday I started preparing the data, by using one single location and exploring how it would have to be manipulated to be useful for the project. I also took a first look at the AR research I finally received from another student. I still need to verify whether it is still up to date, but I can see that it is similar to what I intended to research and has sources and a comparison.

##### Thursday
On Thursday I got delayed a lot due to the public transport strikes and a malfunction in the train, making me stranded at a station waiting for some form of transport. When I did get to school, I continued working on preparing the data and I also managed to create a first visualization of the relevant features.
I also had a meeting with Simona, which I prepared by writing down what I wanted to share and any questions I had. Due to a delay on her side we didn't have enough time to go in depth on everything, but we decided that we wouldn't incorporate NO2 and Ultra Fine Dust Particles in our research as the NO2 was not in our scope and could be used for extension with enough time, and the UFP didn't have consistent enough data.
We also contacted Jean-Paul, who is an expert on Fine Dust to extend our research as literature research did not provide enough information.

She did say that I was doing good, am progressing well. It was not so smart of me to decide to scrape all locations, that was something that could have been resolved by just doing one location at first and expanding the data later.
Though I did have some more questions, they were less urgent so we decided to park them to continue at a later date, which were questions about the CI/CD Pipeline with Gitlab runners, and how I could have better approached the data collection.

##### Friday
On Friday I did a little bit of the backlog of the documentation, such as processing feedback that I wanted some clarification on and updating my weekly progress reports.
I also started working on my AR research and updated my To Do List.
