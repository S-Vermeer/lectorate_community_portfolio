# Progress Report - Week 1

### General info
**Week**: 1
**Phase**: 1 - Problem Definition
**Contacted**: Frank, Simona
**Document(s) handed in**: Project Plan

##### Biggest accomplishment
I managed to use my time efficiently so I did not have any stress about whether I was on track or not.

##### Biggest setback
There was a lot of time between the start of the internship and the first communication with Simona. I was able to set up some stuff, but there was also a lot of time that could have been better spent.

### Daily progress

##### Monday
Monday was the first day of the internship. The first thing I did was contact my coach to see whether he wanted to meet before we were meeting with my internship tutor on Thursday. I met with him for a few minutes at the end of the day. After contacting him, I started transferring all the information of the project proposal to the project plan. When that was done, I started looking at which parts I could already fill in. Things such as who will be involved in my project and a more detailed explanation of my research. After that I worked on researching Augmented Reality for a little bit. Lastly I worked on setting up my organization by creating a To-Do list and figuring out which questions I wanted to ask my coaches on Thursday and setting up a basic documentation template.

##### Tuesday
Tuesday I met most of my fellow interns, had the lectorate interns kick-off and worked on setting up some more of my organization by setting up templates for these weekly progress reports and the accompanying visualization. A lot of time was spent getting to know my fellow interns. I also set up a layout for my portfolio and looked at the Eindhoven Open Data for the first time to see which relevant topics I could find.

##### Wednesday
On Wednesday I worked mostly on research, creating the layout for my research document and seperate documents for more detailed research on topics that might not always be relevant to the main research. I also had my first knowledge sharing session. In this session I introduced myself, my project and what I had already learned about my fellow interns. Later, I started researching the city problems more so I can eventually choose which one I will focus on.

We also thought about a sort of passion project that we wanted to combine with our portfolio, where we would do some sort of vlog and/or blog-esque thing as we noticed that the Lectorate has a significant amount of internship opportunities, however people are not aware that they exist. So we thought that we would document the way we learn during the internship, the setbacks we endure and the tips we get. We also want to document our progress to both show more in depth what the internship looks like, as well as act somewhat like a portfolio. We discussed this with Teague as we did realize that this might be too much work, however he was enthousiastic but hesitant about our time involvement. We agreed to put down on paper what our ideas and goals were, so we could pick on Friday what would be realistically possible approaches that work for us.

##### Thursday
Today I worked on my research about the city problems. I made a lot of progress and found some problems that needed to be addressed such as that biodiversity seems to be one of the most impactful problems but doesn't have the real-time data required for the project or much room for augmented reality.

I also discussed with Frank and Simona about my project. In that meeting I confirmed that Augmented Reality and Location Based Data were non-negotiable requirements for the project. Based on that I got the advise that researching the pros and cons of AR might be a waste of my time and effort. In my scope I said that  I would not be doing CI/CD but my stakeholder mentioned that it might be worth reconsidering as it might save me some time in the long run if I set one up at the start. As for my code, I verified that my stakeholder was also able to do some code reviews. I also needed to make sure that I had some good designs such as a C4, so I should have code architecture in my deliverable. We decided on an Agile approach, though the exact timeframes still need to be decided. We also decided that I would make an app without functionality before adding the proof of concepts to it. I made some agreements on communication and availability and discussed some expectations such as when certain deliverables should be handed in. Lastly I discussed some of the minimum requirements and ideas that we had.

Lastly, I talked to Dennis about what I have been doing so far, and how I have set things up and some of my concerns with the project. He was extremely enthousiastic about what I have been doing so far and didn't doubt that things would work out and that we would figure out together how I could get the best out of myself without going over my limits leading to too much stress at the end.

##### Friday
Friday I have done a lot of research on city problems, and started transferring it to the research document and adding the APA sources.  We also talked to Teague about our project, who was enthousiastic and told us to start working on one or two blogs to see how it works out and if it does work out we could start thinking about how to share it.
