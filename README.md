# lectorate_community_portfolio - ReadMe
## Project
Goal
Attention to the lectorate, the possibilities that it offers. How an internship looks like at the lectorate.

Target audience
Students who want to do an internship at the lectorate.

How?
Weekly media blog that shows the process weekly (could combine with portfolio). Could add a video blog that would air monthly showing what weâ€™ve done at the lectorate.

Goal of the blog
Make our portfolios more publicly accessible and comprehendible.

How much time?
2 hours per week maximum.

## General
The goal of the (weekly) general blog post is to compress the information that is valuable to everyone. For example, for the project plan some aspects are relevant to everyone so they will be put in the general post.
This is also meant for information about the lectorate in general, things we found out that relate to the workings of the 'company'.

## Personal
The goal of the personal blog post is to function as a portfolio. This will be more specific as to what we figured out specific to our project. For example, someone might have a very abstract assignment and figuring out how to define that is not relevant to everyone.
