[Wat is lectoraat basis]
[Waarom deze blog]


Hello we are interns who are currently doing our semester 5 and graduation internship at the lectorate at Fontys. The lectorate is a Fontys based research place where 
interns research different kind of topic on how to help society and people and make prototypes.
We want to make a blog about our time at the lectorate during the internship. With this blog we want to let more people know that you can do an internship at Fontys, 
what an internship entails, the hardships we face during our internship and overcoming those hardships as well.
